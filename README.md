## What is Chug?

Chug is an OS X application that automates installed Homebrew package upgrades and outdated package cleanup with a double click.

## System Requirements

OS X 10.7 or later and support for 64-bit Intel binaries

The Homebrew executable must be installed on the path `/usr/local/bin/brew` (as recommended by the Homebrew developers).  Please see the [Homebrew documentation](http://brew.sh/) for install details.

## Install

Clone the git repository locally with the command:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/chrissimpkins/chug.git
```

or [download the repository ZIP archive file](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/chug/archive/master.zip) and unpack it locally on your system.

Next, drag and drop the Chug.app application in the repository `build` directory to a directory on your OS X system. The Desktop is a pretty handy site but you can place it anywhere that you like.
